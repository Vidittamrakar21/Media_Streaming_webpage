# Media_Streaming_webpage
It is the frontend part of a random, media streaming website , created with pure HTMl , CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.
I created 3 features in it , first is the sub navigation bar, second one is the side bar and the third one is the automatic image slider in the top section,JavaScript is used for it's functionality.
In the movies,webseries and sports section, CSS Grid and flex-box is used for creating and alligning the cards, and for the transition effect on cards, CSS transform and transition properties are used.
